A simple command-line To-Do List application built using Python.
This project focuses on clean control flow, proper list management, and structured user interaction in a terminal environment.

🚀 Features

Add new tasks
View tasks with numbered indexing
Delete tasks by number
Continuous interactive menu
Basic input validation

🛠 Concepts Used

Python lists
while loops
Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
enumerate() for task numbering
Index handling (0-based vs 1-based)
User input processing

📂 Project Structure
todo-list/
├── todo.py
└── README.md

▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python 3.x is installed, then run:
python todo.py

💡 Design Approach
Tasks are stored in a list.
The program runs inside a loop until the user exits.
Tasks are displayed starting from 1 for user clarity.
Internally, Python’s 0-based indexing is handled safely during deletion.

📈 Future Improvements
Persistent storage (file saving)
Task completion status
Due dates and priorities
Refactoring into modular functions
GUI or Web-based version
